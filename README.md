# SudokuSolver
This c++ program uses backtracking to solve any NxN sudoku.
The first input has to be sqrt(N) which is the order of the sudoku.
The sudoku board's input has to be given in the form of a NxN 2-D array of numbers, where the unfilled boxes can be represented by some string other than numbers from 1-N which represent the filled boxes and white spaces.
